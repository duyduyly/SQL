# üß≠ SQL Learning Roadmap
*(From Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced)*

This roadmap will guide you step by step from **SQL beginner** to **advanced**, with explanations, examples, and goals for real-world skills.

---

## ü™¥ Stage 1: Foundations (Beginner Level)

üéØ **Goal:** Understand what SQL is, how data is stored, and how to retrieve it.

### üîπ Topics
1. **What is a Database & SQL**
    - Concepts: tables, rows, columns, schema
    - Difference between SQL and NoSQL

2. **Basic Commands (CRUD)**
    - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
    - `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`

3. **Filtering Data**
    - `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`
    - `DISTINCT` (remove duplicates)

4. **Sorting and Aliases**
    - `ORDER BY`, `AS` (rename columns)

5. **Basic Functions**
    - `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`

### üß† Practice Goals
- Create a small table like `students` or `products`.
- Query and filter data using `SELECT`.
- Update or delete specific rows.

---

## üå± Stage 2: Working with Multiple Tables (Intermediate Level)

üéØ **Goal:** Learn how to organize and connect data efficiently.

### üîπ Topics
1. **Primary Key & Foreign Key**
    - Understand table relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

2. **JOIN Operations**
    - `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`
    - Practice joining multiple tables.

3. **Grouping & Aggregation**
    - `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
    - Combine with aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc.

4. **Subqueries**
    - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders);`

5. **Set Operations**
    - `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`

### üß† Practice Goals
- Design a small database: `customers`, `orders`, `products`.
- Write JOIN queries to get customer order summaries.
- Practice nested queries.

## üåø Stage 3: Schema Design & Data Integrity

üéØ **Goal:** Learn how to design strong, reliable database structures.

### üîπ Topics
1. **CREATE, ALTER, DROP TABLE**
2. **Data Types** (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`, etc.)
3. **Constraints**
    - `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`
4. **Normalization**
    - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF ‚Äî how to remove redundancy and organize data.

### üß† Practice Goals
- Create a schema for a small business (e.g., shop, school, or booking system).
- Apply constraints to enforce data integrity.
- Normalize your tables.

## üå≥ Stage 4: Advanced SQL (Performance & Complex Logic)

üéØ **Goal:** Handle large data, optimize queries, and apply advanced techniques.

### üîπ Topics
1. **Window Functions**
    - `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `OVER(PARTITION BY ...)`
2. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
    - `WITH temp AS (...) SELECT * FROM temp;`
3. **Advanced Subqueries**
    - Correlated subqueries
4. **Transactions**
    - `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
    - ACID principles
5. **Indexes**
    - Create and use indexes for faster lookups
6. **Views**
    - `CREATE VIEW` to simplify complex queries
7. **Stored Procedures / Functions**
    - Reusable SQL code blocks
8. **Triggers**
    - Automatically run actions after insert/update/delete

### üß† Practice Goals
- Write a query to find the top 3 customers by total spending.
- Use `RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` to sort by performance or revenue.
- Optimize a slow query using indexes.

## üå≤ Stage 5: Expert Level (Real-World Mastery)

üéØ **Goal:** Work like a real data engineer or backend developer.

### üîπ Topics
1. **Query Optimization**
    - `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check query plans
    - Understand indexing strategy and performance tuning
2. **Security**
    - SQL injection prevention
    - User permissions and roles
3. **Data Warehousing & Analytics**
    - Learn OLAP concepts: cubes, star schema
4. **Big Data & Integration**
    - Using SQL with tools like Spark SQL, BigQuery, or data pipelines
5. **Real Project Practice**
    - Build analytics dashboards using SQL queries
    - Integrate SQL with your backend (e.g., Java Spring Boot, Python Flask)

## üß≠ Final Tips
‚úÖ Learn **by doing** ‚Äî don‚Äôt just read syntax.  
‚úÖ Always try to **build small projects**, such as:
- A student management system
- A mini e-commerce database
- A movie rating app (like IMDb)
