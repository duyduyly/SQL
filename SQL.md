## what is SQL?
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data stored in tables within a database.

## What is Database and Schema?
### ðŸ’¡ What is the Database?
- A Database is structure collection of data - like digital filing cabinet.
- It stores information in an organized way, making it easily add, find, and manage it.

#
### ðŸ’¡ What is Schema?
- A schema is the structure or blueprint of your database â€” it defines how your data is organized.
  You can think of it as a layout or plan describing
  - What tables exist
  - What columns each table has
  - What data types they store
  - Relationships between tables (keys, constraints, etc.)

#
### Summary:
- âœ… Database: The overall storage container for all your data.
- âœ… Schema: The structure and organization inside a database â€” grouping related tables and defining how they connect.

## Difference between SQL and NoSQL?
| Concept            | **SQL (Relational DB)**                                        | **NoSQL (Non-Relational DB)**                                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**      | Tables (rows & columns)                                        | Collections (documents), key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns                        |
| **Schema**         | Fixed schema (must define columns before inserting data)       | Flexible schema (you can add fields anytime)                                             |
| **Query language** | SQL (standardized)                                             | Each database has its own query style (e.g. MongoDB uses JSON-like syntax)               |
| **Relationships**  | Great for complex relationships using **joins**                | Usually avoids joins; data often embedded                                                |
| **Transactions**   | Strong ACID guarantees (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) | Some NoSQL DBs offer eventual consistency (faster, but not always immediate consistency) |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical (add more power to one server)                        | Horizontal (add more servers easily)                                                     |

#
### ðŸ’¡ When use SQL?
#### Use SQL when:
- Data has a clear structure
- Relationships are important
- Transactions must be accurate
- You need complex queries
- You care about data integrity and strong consistency.

#
#### SQL Databases:
- MySQL (frequent use)
- PostgreSQL (frequent use)
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MariaDB


------------------------
<br/>

### ðŸ’¡ When use NoSQL? (need Read More)
#### Use NoSQL when:
- Data is semi-structured or unstructured
- Schema changes often
- You need to scale massively
- High speed and flexibility matter more than strict structure.
- You donâ€™t need complex joins

#
#### NoSQL Databases:
- MongoDB â†’ Document store (most popular)
- Redis â†’ Key-value store (super fast cache)
- Cassandra â†’ Wide-column store (used by Netflix)
- Neo4j â†’ Graph database (for relationships like social networks)



## In reality, what use SQL for?
- SQL is everywhere â€” hereâ€™s how itâ€™s used in real life:
  1. `Web apps` â€“ When you log in, order something online, or view your profile, the app uses SQL behind the scenes to get or save data.
    - Example: A shopping site runs `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'shoes'`.
  2. `Finance & banking` â€“ SQL is used to manage transactions, accounts, and histories safely and consistently.
  3. `Analytics / Business Intelligence (BI) â€“ Analysts` use SQL to query millions of records to find patterns, make reports, and guide decisions.
  4. `Mobile apps` â€“ Many apps store local data using SQLite, a lightweight SQL database.
  5. `Data science` / AI â€“ SQL helps prepare and filter data before analysis or training models.

## SQL Commands
- `SQL commands` are fundamental building blocks used to perform given operations on database. The operations include queries of data. creating a table, adding data to tables, dropping the table, modifying the table and set permission for users.
